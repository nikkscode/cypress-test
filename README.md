# Container based Cypress-test with React-App
In this repository I want to test, how to integrate the Cypress test framework with the help of a Docker Container that includes a pre-installed Cypress and Browsers on a React-App

## Cypres in Container
As for the container I will use the latest [version](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images/tree/master/included/10.8.0).

1. Check the info of the container by running the command \
```$ docker run -it --entrypoint=cypress cypress/included:10.8.0 info ```\
in order to check the version of Cypress, the system platform, memory as well as the list of preinstalled Browsers.

2. With ``` $ npx cypress open``` start Cypress and configure e2e-Tests and load some predefined e2e tests -> will generate e2e folder and e2e-config in cypress.config.js, which is needed for e2e-Testing with Cypress-Container.

3. Run Tests with Cypress-Container: \
3.1. e2e-Tests:  ``` $ docker run -it -v $PWD:/e2e -w /e2e --entrypoint=cypress cypress/included:10.8.0 run``` \
3.2. Component-Tests: ``` $ docker run -it -v $PWD:/e2e -w /e2e --entrypoint=cypress cypress/included:10.8.0 run --component``` 

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
